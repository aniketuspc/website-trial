        KADAMBA TREE
      </h1>
      <p>
        A fully mature tree can reach up to 45 m (148 ft) in height.[3] It is a large tree with a broad crown and straight cylindrical bole. It is quick growing, with broad spreading branches and grows rapidly in the first 6–8 years. The trunk has a diameter of 100–160 cm, but typically less than that. Leaves are 13–32 cm (5.1–12.6 in) long.[3] Flowering usually begins when the tree is 4–5 years old.
